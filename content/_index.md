# Gérard Paligot

Hi there!

I'm **Gérard Paligot**, **father** of 2 little monsters and **husband** of an incredible woman.
I'm a engineer enthusiast but I'm loving too **Disney** and everything in relation to **space**!

I'm shy person but I'm working on it and became co-organizer of **Lille Android User Group** 
and **French Android User Group** to meet people and exchange with the mobile community!

I'm currently working on two things:

* I'm leading **Mobile Platform Engineering** to standardize, improve and frame the practice of mobile.
* I'm **Staff Software Engineer** with frontend and backend projects with a link to physical stores.

If you are interested about my personal work. I tweet and develop open source projects about Android
development focused on **Jetpack Compose**, **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Architecture**. Feel free to follow me
