# Gérard Paligot

Hi there!

I'm **Gérard Paligot**, **father** of 2 little monsters and **husband** of an incredible woman.
I'm a engineer enthusiast but I'm loving too **Disney** and everything in relation to **space**!

I'm currently working on two things:

* I'm leading **Mobile Platform Engineering** to standardize, improve and frame the practice of mobile.
* I'm **Senior Staff Engineer** on mobile applications at Decathlon Digital.

If you are interested about my personal work. I tweet and develop open source projects about Android
development focused on **Jetpack Compose**, **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Architecture**. Feel free to follow me
on Twitter or GitHub!
